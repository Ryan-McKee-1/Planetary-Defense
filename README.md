# Planetary-Defense
Simulation of satellite and natural body collision dynamics.


# Overview
Simulates orbital mechanics and tests to see if there is a collision with the Earth. The goal is to run a satellite into the astroid in the simulation to move it enough that it doesnt hit Earth.

Initally the satellite will orbit Earth but a future project is to have the satellite hit the astroid far away from the Earth (i.e. Heliocentric orbits)
